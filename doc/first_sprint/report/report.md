#First Sprint report

To sum up everything we have done in the first sprint, we can
say that we managed to implement all the features we planned
to have on our game for the first sprint, we shared the work
between the team members and each one did his part of the job.


#Implemented Features

So the player can move in every direction on the maze, we generate
the game's default maze from a file, the maze may contains some 
monsters and as we mentioned (with no damage and no collision
with game's player) and all this with a basic interface with sprite.


#Problems

We had few problems with generating sprite to make it clear 
it was hard to implements the Sprite and add it to screen but in generale
it we had no problems implementing the rest of features.
